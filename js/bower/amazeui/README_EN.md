## The Product

### Mobile First

Amaze UI believes in Mobile First. Beginning with mobile phone screens, Amaze UI is extending the adaption to larger screens such as tablet and PC.


### Web Components

Amaze UI contains almost 20 CSS components, 10 JS components and 17 other web components which include 60 different themes. All these components are designed to help you develop more efficiently and create responsive pages with awesome user interface and excellent user experience.


### Localization

Compared with existing front-end frameworks, Amaze UI focuses on optimizing page layout in Chinese by adjusting font to different operating systems automatically. Amaze UI provides better compatibility for main trend browsers and browsers built in Apps, saving you a lot of time for compatibility debugging.
